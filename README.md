# StochasticPhaseSpaceSampling
# The purpose of this code is to perform stochastic phase space sampling method to estimate the conversion efficiency from cold atoms to cold molecules. For given particle numbers, temperatures and external trapping potential, the code first generates a distribution in phase space of both species. 
# Then the codes count the number of allowed pairs of atoms, and mark them as paired. The code finishes when no more unmarked pairs of atoms that can form molecules exits. 
# The code was written by Mr. Tomotake Yamakoshi.
